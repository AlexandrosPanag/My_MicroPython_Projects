What Is a Microcontroller?
You may know that a microcontroller is small and not as powerful as the computer on your desktop or in your server rack. What you may not know is that microcontrollers are all around you, adding intelligence and control to your devices. Theyâ€™re embedded in everything from appliances and home security setups to pacemakers, to HVAC systems and more.

Microcontrollers do relatively simple things day after day, reliably, and in a compact package. They compress a CPU, memory, and IO into one general-purpose chip, rather than requiring a whole board of chips that team up to perform a task. The code that they run is called firmware, which is flashed or burned onto writeable memory before executing.

While those who grew up with early microcomputers (like the ZX81 and Commodore Vic20) may find these chips unbelievably powerful, technically, you have way more power available in your smartwatch. Still, microcontrollers are extremely useful, even if their processing power and memory capabilities are limited. A great deal can be done with these little guys!
