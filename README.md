# My MicroPython Projects
-----------------------------------

Why micro python?
Python is one of the most widely used, simple and easy-to-learn programming languages around. So, the emergence of Micro Python makes it extremely easy and simple to program digital electronics. If you’ve never programmed digital electronics before, Micro Python is a good starting point.Micro Python’s goal is to make programming digital electronics as simple as possible, so it can be used by anyone. Currently, Micro Python is used by hobbyists, researchers, teachers, educators, and even in commercial products.

Micro Python is a re-implementation of Python 3 targeted for microcontrollers and embedded systems. Micro Python is very similar with regular Python.MicroPython runs “bare-metal” directly on the hardware: there is no underlying operating system like Windows, macOS, or Linux. All the operations and services usually provided by an operating system are handled directly by Micro Python. Micro Python has complete and direct control of the hardware, so, in effect, MicroPython is the operating system.

Blinking_Led
------------------

A basic project that demonstrates how we can blink the led


Time Counter
------------------

A program that can count and increase a number per second -- a very basic stopwatch app


User Input Blink
-----------------

This program shows how we can create a program that takes a forced user input and makes the Digi Xbee board blink according to user input. 

Hardware Module Identification Plus Internal Temperature
-----------------

A program that shows how we can measure the internal temperature and how we can identify our module's hardware version
